In React Native, using the `Dimensions` API to get screen dimensions can sometimes return incorrect values, particularly during initial app rendering or after device orientation changes.  This is often due to the asynchronous nature of the API and timing issues with component mounting and rendering.  This results in UI elements being positioned or sized incorrectly, leading to visual glitches or layout problems.
